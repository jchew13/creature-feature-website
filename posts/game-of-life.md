When setting out to learn React, I asked a friend what I should build and he suggested I build Conway's Game of Life. I had never heard of it before, but it sounded pretty cool. I decided to build it using [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) and I was able to get it working in a few hours. This was a very satisying forray into React and I suppose some sort of hobby app development creature was born.

It's a pretty wild game. [Read more about it on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
