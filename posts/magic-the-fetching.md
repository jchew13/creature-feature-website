For my next go, I wanted to try another [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) project, but this time integrate an API driven external data source and [MUI](https://mui.com/), a React component library. I decided to build a Magic: The Gathering card search app.

Some friends and I have been playing the Magic: The Gathering format _Commander_ over webcam for a few years now and one of the challenges is being able to see and keep track of all of the cards that are in play at any given time. Using the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/), I was able to build a simple app that allows you to search for cards and add them to a grid of cards on your screen. You can then remove cards from the list as they are removed from the battlefield. Though maybe you'll still want to keep track of them in the graveyard or in exile. They may still be dangerous in any zone these days!

I was actually pretty psyched about how this one turned out. It's super simple and it works; a cool little utility app! Now it's time to move on to some more complex apps. Stay tuned to see what comes **[Next](https://nextjs.org/)**!
